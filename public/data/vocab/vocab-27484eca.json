    {
      "word": "photon",
      "definition": "an elementary particle without a real size that carries electromagnetic radiation",
      "example": "Photons are the basic unit of light and are responsible for carrying energy."

    {
      "word": "duality",
      "definition": "the quality or condition of being dual; a dual state or quality",
      "example": "The concept of wave-particle duality in physics challenges traditional notions of matter."

    {
      "word": "propagate",
      "definition": "to spread or transmit something, such as light, sound, or motion",
      "example": "Light can propagate through a vacuum because it doesn't require a medium to travel."
    },
    {
      "word": "oscillating",
      "definition": "moving back and forth in a regular rhythm",
      "example": "The electric and magnetic fields in light are constantly oscillating as it travels through space."

    {
      "word": "macroscopically",
      "definition": "pertaining to observations made on a large scale or visible to the naked eye",
      "example": "Macroscopically, light appears as a continuous beam, but microscopically, it consists of discrete photons."

      "word": "paradox",
      "definition": "a situation, person, or thing that combines contradictory features or qualities",
      "example": "The twin paradox in physics explores the contradictory nature of time dilation at high speeds."
