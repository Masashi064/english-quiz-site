      "word": "neutrino",
      "definition": "an electrically neutral elementary subatomic particle with a very small mass, usually reacting only to the weak nuclear force.",
      "example": "Neutrinos are produced in large quantities by the nuclear reactions in the sun."

      "word": "leptons",
      "definition": "a group of subatomic particles that do not experience the strong nuclear force, including electrons and neutrinos.",
      "example": "The electron is one of the most well-known leptons in particle physics."

      "word": "quarks",
      "definition": "subatomic particles that combine to form composite particles called hadrons, such as protons and neutrons.",
      "example": "Quarks come in six types or 'flavors': up, down, charm, strange, top, and bottom."

    {
      "word": "bosons",
      "definition": "a type of elementary particle that mediates forces between particles, such as photons for electromagnetism.",
      "example": "The Higgs boson is responsible for giving particles their mass."

      "word": "supernova",
      "definition": "a stellar explosion that briefly outshines an entire galaxy, radiating as much energy as the sun is expected to emit over its entire life span.",
      "example": "The explosion of a supernova can be seen from great distances in space."
