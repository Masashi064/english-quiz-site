  "lead_intro": "Have you ever wondered how living organisms get the resources they need to survive? Let's explore the fascinating world of diffusion and how it impacts life on different scales.",
  "quiz": [
    {
      "question": "What is the rule of the universe that allows molecules to constantly move around and spread in all directions in liquids or gases?",
      "choices": [
        "osmosis",
        "diffusion",
        "gravity"
      ],
      "answer": "diffusion",
      "explanation": "Diffusion is the rule that allows molecules to move around and spread in liquids or gases, essential for transporting materials in living organisms."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why is diffusion a free way of transport for life?",
      "choices": [
        "it requires energy",
        "it's slow",
        "molecules constantly move around"
      ],
      "answer": "molecules constantly move around",
      "explanation": "Diffusion is free for life because molecules are constantly moving around and spreading due to physical laws."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why can't giant bacteria the size of a blue whale survive?",
      "choices": [
        "not enough oxygen",
        "too much surface area",
        "insufficient energy production"
      ],
      "answer": "not enough oxygen",
      "explanation": "Giant bacteria the size of a blue whale cannot survive because oxygen cannot effectively reach the inside due to the square-cube law, leading to insufficient oxygen supply."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do medium-sized animals like humans ensure every cell gets enough resources?",
      "choices": [
        "through specialized breathing organs",
        "by having many blood vessels",
        "by increasing cell size"
      ],
      "answer": "by having many blood vessels",
      "explanation": "Medium-sized animals like humans ensure every cell gets enough resources by having many blood vessels, providing effective diffusion to reach all cells in the body."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why do trees like orange trees need a large surface area?",
      "choices": [
        "to collect sunlight",
        "to maximize diffusion",
        "to increase water absorption"
      ],
      "answer": "to maximize diffusion",
      "explanation": "Trees like orange trees need a large surface area to maximize diffusion for processes like gas exchange and nutrient absorption, crucial for their survival."
