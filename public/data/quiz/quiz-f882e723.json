      "question": "What percentage of the known universe is made up of dark matter?",
      "choices": [
        "25%",
        "50%",
        "75%"
      ],
      "answer": "25%",
      "explanation": "The video mentions that dark matter accounts for about 25% of the known universe."

      "question": "How do we know dark matter is present in the universe?",
      "choices": [
        "It emits light",
        "It interacts with gravity",
        "It reflects light"
      ],
      "answer": "It interacts with gravity",
      "explanation": "Dark matter is detected through its interaction with gravity, such as bending light passing nearby."

      "question": "What did Edward Hubble discover in 1929 that led to understanding the expansion of the universe?",
      "choices": [
        "The universe is contracting",
        "The universe is static",
        "The universe is expanding"
      ],
      "answer": "The universe is expanding",
      "explanation": "Hubble discovered that the universe is expanding by observing the red shift in the light emitted by distant galaxies."

      "question": "What is one proposed idea about dark energy?",
      "choices": [
        "It's a property of matter",
        "It's a type of normal energy",
        "It's a property of space"
      ],
      "answer": "It's a property of space",
      "explanation": "One idea is that dark energy is not a thing but a property of space, suggesting that empty space has its own energy."

      "question": "What was the concept proposed by Einstein in 1917 related to dark energy?",
      "choices": [
        "Cosmological constant",
        "Theory of relativity",
        "Quantum mechanics"
      ],
      "answer": "Cosmological constant",
      "explanation": "Einstein's concept of a cosmological constant was a force that countered the force of gravity, similar to some ideas about dark energy."
