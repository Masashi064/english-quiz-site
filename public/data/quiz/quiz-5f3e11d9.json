      "question": "What can high temperatures do to male embryos of bidded dragons?",
      "choices": [
        "Change them into females",
        "Increase their size",
        "Enhance their chances of survival"
      ],
      "answer": "Change them into females",
      "explanation": "High temperatures can override the genetic sex determination in bidded dragons, causing male embryos to become female."

      "question": "Which species on an island had a ratio of female turtles to male turtles at 116 to 1?",
      "choices": [
        "Crocodiles",
        "Geckos",
        "Sea turtles"
      ],
      "answer": "Sea turtles",
      "explanation": "On one island, female sea turtles greatly outnumbered male sea turtles with a ratio of 116 to 1."

      "question": "What is the advantage of larger size for wolf spiders in the Arctic due to an earlier spring?",
      "choices": [
        "Increased chances of mating",
        "Faster movement",
        "Better camouflage"
      ],
      "answer": "Increased chances of mating",
      "explanation": "Larger wolf spiders in the Arctic benefit from an earlier spring by growing bigger, especially females, which enhances their chances of producing more and larger eggs, ultimately leading to more successful reproduction."

        "They may thrive",
        "They may face extinction",
        "They may grow larger"
      ],
      "answer": "They may face extinction",
      "explanation": "As Earth's temperature changes, some species are forced to adapt or risk facing extinction."

        "Some species being forced to adapt or face extinction"
      ],
      "answer": "Some species being forced to adapt or face extinction",
      "explanation": "With the ecosystem shifting due to Earth's changing climate, some species are thriving while others are compelled to adapt or risk extinction."
