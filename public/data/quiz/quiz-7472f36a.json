  "introduction": "Starring: Christie Wykes as Chlorine, Carbon, and Sodium\nDirector of Photography: Sean McCallum\nGrav",
  "lead_intro": "Learn about chemical bonds and how elements achieve stability through ionic and covalent bonds in this engaging song.",
  "quiz": [
    {
      "question": "According to the song, which type of bond is formed between metals and non-metals?",
      "choices": [
        "Ionic bonds",
        "Covalent bonds",
        "Metallic bonds"
      ],
      "answer": "Ionic bonds",
      "explanation": "In the song, it is mentioned that a bond is made by metals and non-metals through ionic bonds."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the octet rule in chemistry about?",
      "choices": [
        "Having 8 electrons in the outermost shell",
        "Having 10 electrons in the outermost shell",
        "Having 6 electrons in the outermost shell"
      ],
      "answer": "Having 8 electrons in the outermost shell",
      "explanation": "The octet rule states that atoms tend to gain, lose, or share electrons to have 8 electrons in their outermost shell for stability."
    },
    {
      "question": "What will happen if atoms share six electrons according to the song?",
      "choices": [
        "Both achieve noble gas configuration",
        "Create metallic bonds",
        "Form an ionic bond"
      ],
      "answer": "Both achieve noble gas configuration",
      "explanation": "Sharing six electrons allows both atoms to achieve noble gas configuration and release energy through covalent bonds."
    },
    {
      "question": "What kind of forces are abundant in metallic bonds?",
      "choices": [
        "Mutual attractive forces",
        "Repulsive forces",
        "Covalent forces"
      ],
      "answer": "Mutual attractive forces",
      "explanation": "In metallic bonds, the free electrons around the atoms experience mutual attractive forces that hold the structure together."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which type of bond has similar electronegativity among non-metals?",
      "choices": [
        "Covalent bonds",
        "Ionic bonds",
        "Metallic bonds"
      ],
      "answer": "Covalent bonds",
      "explanation": "Non-metals share electrons in covalent bonds as they have similar electronegativity, leading to stable chemical compounds."
