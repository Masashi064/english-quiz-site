    {
      "question": "What is the density of a sun-mass black hole?",
      "choices": [
        "6 km wide",
        "6 blue whales per cubic meter",
        "24 million kilometers"
      ],
      "answer": "6 blue whales per cubic meter",
      "explanation": "The video mentions that a sun-mass black hole has a density of about one Himalayan range per cubic meter, which is equivalent to 6 blue whales per cubic meter."
    },
    {
      "question": "According to the video, what is the average density of the universe?",
      "choices": [
        "5 hydrogen atoms per cubic meter",
        "5 blue whales per cubic meter",
        "5 black holes per cubic meter"
      ],
      "answer": "5 hydrogen atoms per cubic meter",
      "explanation": "The video states that if you break up all the galaxies, stars, gas, and energy in the observable universe and spread them equally, the average density would be about 5 hydrogen atoms per cubic meter."
    },
    {
      "question": "Inside a black hole, how does space differ from time?",
      "choices": [
        "Space goes on forever but time is finite",
        "Space is finite but time goes on forever",
        "Space and time are both finite"
      ],
      "answer": "Space goes on forever but time is finite",
      "explanation": "Within a black hole, space goes on forever while time is finite, which is opposite to our usual perception of space and time."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the singularity of a black hole?",
      "choices": [
        "A point in space",
        "A point in time",
        "An event in time that happens"
      ],
      "answer": "An event in time that happens",
      "explanation": "The singularity of a black hole is described as an event in time that happens, where everything inside the black hole is crushed into an infinitely small region."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is one possible scenario for the end of our universe?",
      "choices": [
        "The Big Crunch",
        "The Big Bounce",
        "The Big Bang"
      ],
      "answer": "The Big Crunch",
      "explanation": "The video mentions the Big Crunch as a scenario where the universe collapses into a singularity, similar to the end of a black hole universe."
