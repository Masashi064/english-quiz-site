  "introduction": "So, which one of these handy gadgets are you getting first? ðŸ‘€ \n\n#kurzgesagt\n#inanutshell #kurzgesag",
  "lead_intro": "Space cleanup is crucial as lower orbits are cluttered with tons of debris. Let's explore three innovative solutions for this cosmic mess!",
  "quiz": [
    {
      "question": "What is the purpose of the laser broom 3000?",
      "choices": [
        "To vaporize small satellite debris",
        "To capture space harpoons",
        "To increase atmospheric drag"
      ],
      "answer": "To vaporize small satellite debris",
      "explanation": "The laser broom 3000 is designed to vaporize parts of the junk with its precise laser technology, providing directional thrust to lower the orbit of small satellite debris."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the function of the space harpoon in space cleanup?",
      "choices": [
        "To absorb small debris",
        "To increase atmospheric drag",
        "To capture cosmic trash"
      ],
      "answer": "To capture cosmic trash",
      "explanation": "The space harpoon is used to latch onto cosmic trash by launching a tethered harpoon at the debris, allowing for the satellite to be pulled into the atmosphere for disposal."
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the deorbit platform help in cleaning up space?",
      "choices": [
        "By absorbing smaller debris",
        "By increasing satellite drag",
        "By vaporizing space junk"
      ],
      "answer": "By absorbing smaller debris",
      "explanation": "The sponge foam released from the deorbit platform absorbs smaller debris in space, making it easier to drag them back to Earth for disposal."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is one limitation of using the space cleanup solutions mentioned?",
      "choices": [
        "Restricted to outer space only",
        "Ineffective against large debris",
        "Requires frequent recharging"
      ],
      "answer": "Restricted to outer space only",
      "explanation": "The use of these space cleanup solutions is limited to outer space and is strongly discouraged for household cleanup duties."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the purpose of the sail in the space harpoon cleanup process?",
      "choices": [
        "To increase drag and pull the satellite",
        "To capture small specks of dirt",
        "To release foam for absorption"
      ],
      "answer": "To increase drag and pull the satellite",
      "explanation": "The sail attached to the harpoon increases drag, aiding in pulling the satellite into the atmosphere by increasing atmospheric resistance."
