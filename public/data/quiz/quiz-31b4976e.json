  "quiz": [
    {
      "question": "What caused parts of the spinning dust and gas cloud to collapse and start forming our solar system?",
      "choices": [
        "Nearby supernova shock wave",
        "Comet impact",
        "Solar wind"
      ],
      "answer": "Nearby supernova shock wave",
      "explanation": "The shock wave of a nearby supernova caused parts of the cloud to collapse and start forming our solar system."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why did the smaller cloud start to spin faster as it collapsed?",
      "choices": [
        "Gravity from the sun",
        "Nearby black hole",
        "Magnetic field"
      ],
      "answer": "Gravity from the sun",
      "explanation": "The smaller cloud started to spin faster due to the increased mass located closer to the axis of rotation, similar to ice skaters pulling in their arms."
    },
    {
      "question": "What eventually formed in the center of the spinning cloud?",
      "choices": [
        "The sun",
        "An asteroid",
        "A moon"
      ],
      "answer": "The sun",
      "explanation": "In the center of the spinning cloud, the hydrogen was compressed and eventually fused into helium, forming our sun."
    },
    {
      "question": "How did gravity influence the formation of planets in the spinning disc?",
      "choices": [
        "Clumping particles together",
        "Pushing them away",
        "Creating a vacuum"
      ],
      "answer": "Clumping particles together",
      "explanation": "Gravity from the sun clumped the remaining particles together in the spinning disc, leading to the formation of planets through countless collisions."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why do all planets orbit the sun in a nearly flat plane?",
      "choices": [
        "Due to the spinning disc's gravity",
        "Influence of meteorites",
        "Random chance"
      ],
      "answer": "Due to the spinning disc's gravity",
      "explanation": "All planets orbit the sun in a nearly flat plane because the gravity from the sun in the center of the spinning disc prevented particles from escaping the disc's plane."
