      "question": "Approximately what percentage of stars in the universe are red dwarfs?",
      "choices": [
        "20%",
        "50%",
        "70%"
      ],

      "question": "What is the average lifespan of a red dwarf?",
      "choices": [
        "1-10 million years",
        "1-10 trillion years",
        "100-500 billion years"

      "question": "Why is a planet orbiting very close to a red dwarf likely to be inhospitable for life?",
      "choices": [
        "It would be too far from the star's energy",
        "It would be tidally locked",
        "It would receive too much sunlight"

      "answer": "It would be tidally locked",
      "explanation": "A planet close to a red dwarf would likely be tidally locked, with one side facing the star being incredibly hot and the other frozen."

      "question": "What happens to a red dwarf when its hydrogen runs out?",
      "choices": [
        "It transforms into a blue dwarf",
