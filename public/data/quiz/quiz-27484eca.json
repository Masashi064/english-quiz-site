      "question": "Why is visible light considered special to humans?",
      "choices": [
        "Due to its ability to penetrate solid objects",
        "Because it is the only form of radiation with wave-particle duality",
        "Evolution of eyes that are sensitive to it"
      ],
      "answer": "Evolution of eyes that are sensitive to it",
      "explanation": "Visible light is not inherently special, but humans have evolved eyes that are particularly adept at perceiving this part of the electromagnetic spectrum."
