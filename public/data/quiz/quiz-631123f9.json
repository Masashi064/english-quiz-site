      "question": "What is the main role of bacteriophages in the human body?",
      "choices": [
        "Hunting down and killing resident bacteria",
        "Infecting human cells",
        "Producing vitamins in the gut"
      ],
      "answer": "Hunting down and killing resident bacteria",
      "explanation": "Bacteriophages are specialized in hunting down and killing resident bacteria in the human body, playing a crucial role in controlling bacterial populations."

    {
      "question": "What deadly gift does the CTXφ bacteriophage give to Vibrio cholerae bacteria?",
      "choices": [
        "Genes for the cholera toxin",
        "Genes for synthesizing vitamins",
        "Genes for antibiotic resistance"
      ],
      "answer": "Genes for the cholera toxin",
      "explanation": "The CTXφ bacteriophage gives the Vibrio cholerae bacteria the genes for the cholera toxin, making the bacteria extremely dangerous and leading to severe illnesses in humans."

      "question": "How do oncolytic viruses target cancer cells?",
      "choices": [
        "By hitting specific adaptations of cancer cells",
        "By boosting the immune system",
        "By infecting healthy cells"
      ],
      "answer": "By hitting specific adaptations of cancer cells",
      "explanation": "Oncolytic viruses specialize in targeting specific adaptations of cancer cells, taking over and turning them into virus production factories, ultimately leading to the death of the cancer cells."

    {
      "question": "What is one side effect of oncolytic viruses attacking cancer cells?",
      "choices": [
        "Attracting immune cells to attack the tumor",
        "Suppressing the immune system",
        "Causing mutations in healthy cells"
      ],
      "answer": "Attracting immune cells to attack the tumor",
      "explanation": "The attack of oncolytic viruses on cancer cells attracts immune cells to the tumor site, triggering a strong immune response against the cancer."
