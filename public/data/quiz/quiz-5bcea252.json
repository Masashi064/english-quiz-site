  "quiz": [
    {
      "question": "Why does cereal stick to a magnet according to the video?",
      "choices": [
        "iron content",
        "plastic content",
        "water content"
      ],
      "answer": "iron content",
      "explanation": "Cereal sticks to a magnet due to the iron content in it, which makes it attracted to magnetic fields."
    },
    {
      "question": "How can you find the center of mass of a cane or stick-type object?",
      "choices": [
        "move fingers in towards the middle",
        "tap on the surface",
        "rotate the object"
      ],
      "answer": "move fingers in towards the middle",
      "explanation": "By moving your fingers in towards the middle from the outside, you can find the center of mass of a cane or stick-type object."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why does a phone rotate around the short axis when flipped end over end?",
      "choices": [
        "short axis has least moment of inertia",
        "long axis has least moment of inertia",
        "intermediate axis has least moment of inertia"
      ],
      "answer": "short axis has least moment of inertia",
      "explanation": "When flipping a phone end over end, it rotates around the short axis due to it having the least moment of inertia compared to the other axes."
    },
    {
      "question": "What causes an electrically charged object to deflect a stream of water?",
      "choices": [
        "dissolved ions in water",
        "water being a polar molecule",
        "oxygen content in water"
      ],
      "answer": "dissolved ions in water",
      "explanation": "An electrically charged object deflects a stream of water due to dissolved ions in the water, not solely because water is a polar molecule."

    {
      "question": "Why does a teabag rocket take off into the air when lit on fire?",
      "choices": [
        "hot air inside expands and rises",
        "teabag becomes lighter",
        "cool air inside heats up"
      ],
      "answer": "hot air inside expands and rises",
      "explanation": "A teabag rocket takes off into the air because the hot air inside expands, becomes less dense, and is pushed up by the cooler air around it, creating a convection current."
