    {
      "question": "Why does the sky appear blue?",
      "choices": [
        "The scattering of blue light",
        "The absorption of red light",
        "The reflection of yellow light"
      ],
      "answer": "The scattering of blue light",
      "explanation": "The Earth's atmosphere scatters blue light with shorter wavelengths more than red light, resulting in the blue color of the sky."
    },
    {
      "question": "What causes the sky to appear yellow during sunrise and sunset?",
      "choices": [
        "Scattering of blue light",
        "Scattering of red light",
        "Absorption of yellow light"
      ],
      "answer": "Scattering of blue light",
      "explanation": "During sunrise and sunset, the sunlight passes through more atmosphere, causing more blue light to scatter and making the Sun appear yellow."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why does the Sun appear yellow to us?",
      "choices": [
        "Scattering of red light",
        "Absorption of blue light",
        "Scattering of blue light"
      ],
      "answer": "Scattering of blue light",
      "explanation": "The scattering of blue light by Earth's atmosphere makes the Sun, which emits light in all colors, appear yellow to us."
    },
    {
      "question": "What happens when you mix all colors of light together?",
      "choices": [
        "You get white light",
        "You get black light",
        "You get yellow light"
      ],
      "answer": "You get white light",
      "explanation": "Mixing all colors of light results in white light, which is the true color of sunlight."

    {
      "question": "What enhances the beauty of ocean sunsets?",
      "choices": [
        "Scattering of red light by water vapor and particles",
        "Absorption of blue light by clouds",
        "Reflection of green light by trees"
      ],
      "answer": "Scattering of red light by water vapor and particles",
      "explanation": "The scattering of red light by water vapor and particles in the atmosphere contributes to the breathtaking beauty of ocean sunsets."
