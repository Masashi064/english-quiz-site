    {
      "question": "According to the text, how many dimensions make up our universe?",
      "choices": [
        "two",
        "three",
        "four"
      ],
      "answer": "four",
      "explanation": "The text mentions that our universe is believed to be four-dimensional, consisting of three spatial dimensions and one time dimension."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the term used for particles that could potentially move faster than light and travel backwards in time?",
      "choices": [
        "luminons",
        "tachyons",
        "gravitons"
      ],
      "answer": "tachyons",
      "explanation": "Scientists have theorized the existence of particles called 'tachyons' that could travel faster than light and move backwards in time."
    },
    {
      "question": "What phenomenon causes time to pass slower near massive objects like black holes?",
      "choices": [
        "time dilation",
        "gravity fluctuation",
        "event horizon effect"
      ],
      "answer": "time dilation",
      "explanation": "Time dilation is the effect where time passes slower near massive objects, like black holes, due to the bending of spacetime by gravity."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the name of the paradox involving twins aging differently due to one traveling at high speed in space?",
      "choices": [
        "space paradox",
        "twin paradox",
        "time divergence"
      ],
      "answer": "twin paradox",
      "explanation": "The scenario where one twin travels at high speed through space while the other remains on Earth, resulting in different aging rates, is known as the 'twin paradox'."

    {
      "question": "What is the speed at which photons move through space?",
      "choices": [
        "speed of sound",
        "speed of light",
        "speed of darkness"
      ],
      "answer": "speed of light",
      "explanation": "Photons, which are light particles, move at the speed of light through space, experiencing no passage of time in their frame of reference."
