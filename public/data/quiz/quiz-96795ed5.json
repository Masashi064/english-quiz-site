        "100,000 colors",

      "question": "Why is it unlikely that we all see the exact same set of colors?",
      "choices": [
        "Because of different brain structures",
        "Because of different wavelengths",
        "Because of how we perceive them"
      ],
      "answer": "Because of how we perceive them",
      "explanation": "The text explains that even though the wavelengths we receive are the same, how we perceive colors varies, leading to the likelihood that we all see colors differently."
