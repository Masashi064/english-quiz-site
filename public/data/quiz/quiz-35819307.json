      "question": "In what year did Watson, Crick, and Wilkins win the Nobel Prize for their work on DNA?",
      "choices": [
        "1962",
        "1958",
        "1975"
      ],
      "answer": "1962",
      "explanation": "James Watson, Francis Crick, and Maurice Wilkins were awarded the Nobel Prize in 1962 for their significant contributions to the discovery of the structure of DNA."

    {
      "question": "Why was Rosalind Franklin's role in the discovery of the DNA structure initially underplayed?",
      "choices": [
        "Manuscripts were published together but Franklin's last",
        "She stopped working on DNA before Watson and Crick's publication",
        "Her experiments confirmed Watson and Crick's breakthrough"
      ],
      "answer": "Manuscripts were published together but Franklin's last",
      "explanation": "Although Rosalind Franklin's manuscript confirming the DNA structure was published together with Watson and Crick's, it was placed last, giving the impression that her role was secondary."
