    {
      "question": "Where is the deep biosphere located?",
      "choices": [
        "inside the Earth's crust",
        "on the surface of Venus",
        "in the Earth's atmosphere"
      ],
      "answer": "inside the Earth's crust",
      "explanation": "The deep biosphere, home to extreme beings, is located inside the Earth's crust."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the deep biosphere's volume compared to Earth's oceans?",
      "choices": [
        "twice as large",
        "half the size",
        "equal in volume"
      ],
      "answer": "twice as large",
      "explanation": "The volume of the deep biosphere is at least twice as large as all of Earth's oceans."
    },
    {
      "question": "Where does the journey into the deep biosphere begin?",
      "choices": [
        "on land, in the soil",
        "under the ocean",
        "in the Earth's mantle"
      ],
      "answer": "on land, in the soil",
      "explanation": "The journey into the deep biosphere starts on land, in the soil, the top layer of the Earth, rich in air, water, minerals, and organic matter."

    {
      "question": "What is a characteristic of microbes living in the deep biosphere?",
      "choices": [
        "consume very little and conserve energy",
        "rapid metabolism",
        "high oxygen requirement"
      ],
      "answer": "consume very little and conserve energy",
      "explanation": "Microbes in the deep biosphere have a slow metabolism, consuming very little and conserving energy to survive in harsh conditions."

    {
      "question": "What is a survival strategy of microbes in the deep biosphere?",
      "choices": [
        "forming consortia to share work",
        "constant reproduction",
        "high consumption of resources"
      ],
      "answer": "forming consortia to share work",
      "explanation": "Microbes in the deep biosphere form consortia, working together in biofilms to shield against extremes and share tasks like methane consumption and electron conversion."
