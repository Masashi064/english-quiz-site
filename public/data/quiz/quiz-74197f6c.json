    {
      "question": "What did Edwin Hubble discover about galaxies?",
      "choices": [
        "they are moving apart from each other",
        "they are stationary",
        "they are getting closer together"
      ],
      "answer": "they are moving apart from each other",
      "explanation": "Edwin Hubble discovered that galaxies are moving apart from one another, supporting the theory of the expanding universe."

    {
      "question": "What is the Big Bang theory?",
      "choices": [
        "an explosion",
        "all space stretching everywhere",
        "a collision of galaxies"
      ],
      "answer": "all space stretching everywhere",
      "explanation": "The Big Bang was not an explosion but rather all space stretching everywhere at once, leading to the rapid expansion of the universe."

        "pairs of quarks",
        "photons",
        "neutrons"
      ],
      "answer": "pairs of quarks",
      "explanation": "Gluons in the early universe formed pairs of quarks, which interacted briefly before annihilating each other and giving rise to more gluons."

        "oxygen"
      ],
      "answer": "hydrogen",
      "explanation": "As the universe cooled, the first atom, hydrogen, was formed from the decay of neutrons into protons, marking a significant stage in the universe's evolution."

      ],
      "answer": "plasma",
      "explanation": "The radiation from stars and galaxies converted stable hydrogen gas into plasma, which still exists in the universe today and allows visible light to pass through."
