    {
      "question": "What are the basic principles behind mining an asteroid?",
      "choices": [
        "Choose an asteroid, move it to an easy processing place, and take it apart",
        "Explode the asteroid, collect debris, and send it to Earth",
        "Leave the asteroid as it is and observe it from a distance"
      ],
      "answer": "Choose an asteroid, move it to an easy processing place, and take it apart",
      "explanation": "The basic idea behind mining an asteroid is to choose an asteroid, move it to a place where it's easy to process, and then take it apart to turn it into useful products."

    {
      "question": "What makes asteroid mining on Earth currently unfeasible?",
      "choices": [
        "Lack of suitable asteroids",
        "High cost of space travel",
        "Too much competition in the industry"
      ],
      "answer": "High cost of space travel",
      "explanation": "The high cost of space travel, especially in terms of rocket fuel expenses, is one of the major challenges that make asteroid mining on Earth currently unfeasible."

    {
      "question": "What is one proposed solution to make asteroid mining profitable?",
      "choices": [
        "Using traditional rockets for space travel",
        "Building larger asteroid processing facilities",
        "Switching from classical rockets to electric spaceships"
      ],
      "answer": "Switching from classical rockets to electric spaceships",
      "explanation": "One proposed solution to make asteroid mining profitable is to switch from classical rockets to electric spaceships, which are more fuel-efficient and could reduce the overall cost of space travel."

    {
      "question": "How is the processing of asteroids in space different from on Earth?",
      "choices": [
        "Asteroids are transported back to Earth for processing",
        "Asteroids are processed using traditional mining equipment",
        "Asteroids are processed using solar heat and centrifuges in space"
      ],
      "answer": "Asteroids are processed using solar heat and centrifuges in space",
      "explanation": "In space, asteroids are processed using giant mirrors to focus sunlight and heat up the rock, followed by grinders to break up the rocks and centrifuges to separate elements, which is a different process compared to traditional mining on Earth."
