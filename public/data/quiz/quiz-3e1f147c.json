  "quiz": [
    {
      "question": "What is the core of a star fusing hydrogen atoms into until it reaches iron, causing a sudden imbalance between radiation and gravity?",
      "choices": [
        "helium",
        "iron",
        "neutron star"
      ],
      "answer": "iron",
      "explanation": "The fusion process in the core of a star leads to the creation of iron, which builds up until it causes a sudden imbalance between radiation and gravity, leading to a supernova explosion."
    },
    {
      "question": "What happens to a star when the balance between radiation and gravity is broken in its core?",
      "choices": [
        "it collapses",
        "it expands",
        "it stabilizes"
      ],
      "answer": "it collapses",
      "explanation": "When the balance between radiation and gravity is broken in a star's core, the star collapses and undergoes a supernova explosion."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the 'event horizon' of a black hole?",
      "choices": [
        "the singularity",
        "the black sphere reflecting nothing",
        "the point where nothing can escape"
      ],
      "answer": "the point where nothing can escape",
      "explanation": "The event horizon of a black hole is the point where anything that crosses it needs to be traveling faster than the speed of light to escape, making escape impossible."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the 'singularity' of a black hole known for?",
      "choices": [
        "it is indefinitely dense",
        "it has a surface and volume",
        "it generates energy"
      ],
      "answer": "it is indefinitely dense",
      "explanation": "The singularity of a black hole may be indefinitely dense, with all its mass concentrated into a single point in space, without any surface or volume."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do black holes eventually evaporate over time?",
      "choices": [
        "through Hawking radiation",
        "by consuming all nearby matter",
        "by expanding in size"
      ],
      "answer": "through Hawking radiation",
      "explanation": "Black holes eventually evaporate through a process called Hawking radiation, where they lose energy gradually by emitting particles."
