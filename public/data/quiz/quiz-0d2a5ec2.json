  "lead_intro": "Ever wondered about the idea of shooting nuclear waste into space? Let's dive into why it's not just a bad idea but a horribly bad one, as explained by Kurzgesagt.",
  "quiz": [
    {
      "question": "What percentage of nuclear waste is categorized as high level nuclear waste?",
      "choices": [
        "3%",
        "7%",
        "90%"
      ],
      "answer": "3%",
      "explanation": "High level nuclear waste, the most dangerous type, makes up 3% of all nuclear waste."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why would launching nuclear waste into space make nuclear fuel for reactors more expensive?",
      "choices": [
        "It increases the cost of space launches",
        "It decreases the demand for nuclear fuel",
        "It improves the efficiency of nuclear reactors"
      ],
      "answer": "It increases the cost of space launches",
      "explanation": "Launching nuclear waste into space significantly raises the cost of space launches, making nuclear fuel for reactors more expensive."
    },
    {
      "question": "What problem arises when considering launching nuclear waste into low earth orbit?",
      "choices": [
        "Space junk management issues",
        "Atmospheric interference",
        "Meteor showers"
      ],
      "answer": "Space junk management issues",
      "explanation": "Littering low earth orbit with nuclear waste would create challenges in space junk management and satellite collision avoidance."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why is it harder to launch a rocket into the sun than out of the solar system?",
      "choices": [
        "Orbital motion cancellation",
        "Strong solar gravity",
        "Sun's atmosphere"
      ],
      "answer": "Orbital motion cancellation",
      "explanation": "Launching a rocket into the sun requires canceling out all its orbital motion around the sun, making it easier to launch a rocket out of the solar system."
    },
    {
      "question": "What are the potential consequences of a rocket carrying nuclear waste failing during launch?",
      "choices": [
        "Radioactive contamination",
        "Increased rocket efficiency",
        "Enhanced space exploration"
      ],
      "answer": "Radioactive contamination",
      "explanation": "A rocket failure carrying high level nuclear waste could lead to radioactive contamination, affecting farmlands, food, and water supplies."
