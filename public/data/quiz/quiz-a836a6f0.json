  "quiz": [
    {
      "question": "What happens to a very massive star during a supernova?",
      "choices": [
        "collapses into a superdense neutron star",
        "expands into a white dwarf",
        "transforms into a black hole"
      ],
      "answer": "collapses into a superdense neutron star",
      "explanation": "During a supernova, a very massive star collapses under its extreme gravity and can either compress into a superdense neutron star or collapse into a singularity."
    },
    {
      "question": "How is a gravastar different from a black hole?",
      "choices": [
        "Has a physical shell made of matter",
        "Has an event horizon",
        "Is infinitely dense"
      ],
      "answer": "Has a physical shell made of matter",
      "explanation": "A key difference is that gravastars have a physical shell made of matter, while black holes have an event horizon."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the interior of a gravastar like?",
      "choices": [
        "Empty vacuum without atoms or particles",
        "Filled with exotic matter",
        "Contains quarks and photons"
      ],
      "answer": "Empty vacuum without atoms or particles",
      "explanation": "The interior of a gravastar is described as a perfectly empty vacuum without a single atom, particle, or wave, but it contains fundamental energy."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do gravastars and black holes behave similarly?",
      "choices": [
        "Both massively curve space around them",
        "Reflect all light that hits them",
        "Rotate at extremely high speeds"
      ],
      "answer": "Both massively curve space around them",
      "explanation": "Gravastars and black holes both massively curve space around them and exhibit similar gravitational effects."
    },
    {
      "question": "What potential do gravastars have in the field of physics?",
      "choices": [
        "Answer some of the biggest problems in physics",
        "Create more mysteries than black holes",
        "Violate the laws of physics"
      ],
      "answer": "Answer some of the biggest problems in physics",
      "explanation": "Gravastars have the potential to answer significant questions in physics without the issues associated with singularities found in black holes."
