    {
      "question": "What type of reactor became prevalent in the 1970s due to its simplicity and cost-effectiveness?",
      "choices": [
        "fast breeder reactor",
        "light water reactor",
        "gas-cooled reactor"
      ],
      "answer": "light water reactor",
      "explanation": "The light water reactor became prevalent in the 1970s due to its simplicity and cost-effectiveness, even though it was not the safest or most efficient type of reactor."
    },
    {
      "question": "What caused the renewed interest and investment in nuclear power in the early 1970s?",
      "choices": [
        "Discovery of new radioactive elements",
        "War in the Middle East",
        "Oil price decrease"
      ],
      "answer": "War in the Middle East",
      "explanation": "The war in the Middle East in the early 1970s led to a significant increase in oil prices, prompting renewed interest and investment in nuclear power worldwide."

      "question": "What event in 1979 almost led to a catastrophe at the Three Mile Island nuclear plant?",
      "choices": [
        "Core meltdown",
        "Tsunami",
        "Earthquake"
      ],
      "answer": "Core meltdown",
      "explanation": "In 1979, the Three Mile Island nuclear plant in Pennsylvania almost faced a catastrophe when its core melted, highlighting the risks associated with nuclear power."

      "question": "What is the basic principle of a light water reactor?",
      "choices": [
        "Heating air using nuclear fusion",
        "Heating water through a chain reaction",
        "Producing electricity using solar power"
      ],
      "answer": "Heating water through a chain reaction",
      "explanation": "A light water reactor heats up water through an artificial chain reaction, where nuclear fission releases energy that heats the surrounding water to produce steam for driving turbines."
