      "question": "What was one of the major challenges faced in constructing the Sabah Al Ahmad Sea City project?",
      "choices": [
        "limited space for construction",
        "lack of funds for the project",
        "political conflicts in the region"
      ],
      "answer": "limited space for construction",
      "explanation": "The challenge of limited space due to the coastal area being already built up was a significant obstacle in constructing the city."
