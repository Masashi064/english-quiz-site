  "quiz": [
    {
      "question": "What is the predicted outcome when releasing the balance with the two balls in water? ",
      "choices": [
        "The balance will tip towards the acrylic ball",
        "The balance will tip towards the ping pong ball",
        "The balance will remain perfectly balanced"
      ],
      "answer": "The balance will tip towards the ping pong ball",
      "explanation": "Despite the ping pong ball being lighter and tethered, the balance will tip towards it due to the forces acting on the system."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why does the balance tip towards the ping pong ball?",
      "choices": [
        "The ping pong ball is denser than water",
        "The ping pong ball is lighter",
        "The acrylic ball exerts a stronger force"
      ],
      "answer": "The ping pong ball is lighter",
      "explanation": "Even though the ping pong ball is lighter and tethered, it still causes the balance to tip because of the forces involved."
    },
    {
      "question": "What role does tension play in the experiment?",
      "choices": [
        "Tension causes the balance to remain stable",
        "Tension pulls the acrylic ball down",
        "Tension contributes to the ping pong ball side rising"
      ],
      "answer": "Tension contributes to the ping pong ball side rising",
      "explanation": "The tension in the tether affects the forces acting on the system, leading to the ping pong ball side rising."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do the forces influence the balance's movement?",
      "choices": [
        "The normal force causes the balance to tip towards the acrylic ball",
        "The forces are balanced leading to no movement",
        "The normal force tips the balance towards the ping pong ball"
      ],
      "answer": "The normal force tips the balance towards the ping pong ball",
      "explanation": "The normal force on the ping pong ball side causes the balance to tip in that direction, overcoming other forces in play."
    },
    {
      "question": "What was the final outcome of the experiment?",
      "choices": [
        "The balance tipped towards the acrylic ball",
        "The balance remained perfectly balanced",
        "The balance tipped towards the ping pong ball"
      ],
      "answer": "The balance tipped towards the ping pong ball",
      "explanation": "In the experiment, the balance tipped towards the ping pong ball side, contrary to initial predictions, showcasing the impact of forces in the system."
