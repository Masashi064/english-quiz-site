    {
      "question": "What is another name for a tardigrade?",
      "choices": [
        "water bear",
        "gummy bear",
        "polar bear"
      ],
      "answer": "water bear",
      "explanation": "Tardigrades are also known as water bears due to their ability to survive without water for extended periods."
    },
    {
      "question": "What process do tardigrades use to survive without water?",
      "choices": [
        "anhydrobiosis",
        "photosynthesis",
        "fermentation"
      ],
      "answer": "anhydrobiosis",
      "explanation": "Tardigrades employ anhydrobiosis, which allows them to live without water by entering a tun state and preserving their cells."
    },
    {
      "question": "How many known species of tardigrades are there?",
      "choices": [
        "over 1100",
        "around 500",
        "less than 100"
      ],
      "answer": "over 1100",
      "explanation": "There are over 1100 known species of tardigrades, indicating their diverse presence across different environments."
    },
    {
      "question": "Where can tardigrades be found?",
      "choices": [
        "everywhere",
        "only in rainforests",
        "exclusively in deserts"
      ],
      "answer": "everywhere",
      "explanation": "Tardigrades exist in diverse biomes worldwide, including deserts, rainforests, ice sheets, and even the highest mountain peaks."
    },
    {
      "question": "What potential applications could studying tardigrades have?",
      "choices": [
        "stabilizing vaccines and developing stress-tolerant crops",
        "inventing space travel",
        "creating new medicines"
      ],
      "answer": "stabilizing vaccines and developing stress-tolerant crops",
      "explanation": "By understanding how tardigrades stabilize their biological molecules, scientists may apply this knowledge to enhance vaccine stability and create crops resilient to climate change."
