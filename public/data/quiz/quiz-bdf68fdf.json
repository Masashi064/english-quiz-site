    {
      "question": "What is the prior probability that the person in the video has the rare disease before taking the test?",

        "0.1%",
        "9%",
        "99%"
      ],
      "answer": "0.1%",
      "explanation": "The prior probability of having the rare disease is 0.1%, based on its frequency in the population."
    },
    {
      "question": "After testing positive for the disease, what is the probability that the person in the video actually has the disease?",

        "9%",
        "91%",
        "99%"

      "answer": "9%",
      "explanation": "Using Bayes' Theorem, the probability of actually having the disease after testing positive is 9%."

      "answer": "A man seeing the Sun rise every day",
      "explanation": "The analogy of a man seeing the Sun rise every day is used to illustrate how Bayes' Theorem is intended to be applied multiple times, updating beliefs with new evidence."

      "question": "How does the video suggest one can avoid a self-fulfilling prophecy?",
      "choices": [
        "By experimenting and trying new things",
        "By sticking to the same routine",
        "By avoiding change"
      ],
      "answer": "By experimenting and trying new things",
      "explanation": "The video emphasizes that a good understanding of Bayes' Theorem implies the importance of experimentation to avoid being stuck in a self-fulfilling prophecy."
