  "quiz": [
    {
      "question": "What makes gamma rays dangerous to living organisms?",
      "choices": [
        "They are small particles",
        "They are ionizing radiation",
        "They are visible to the naked eye"
      ],
      "answer": "They are ionizing radiation",
      "explanation": "Gamma rays are considered dangerous because they are a form of ionizing radiation, which means they are energetic enough to break apart atomic bonds."
    },
    {
      "question": "How were gamma ray bursts (GRBs) from space discovered?",
      "choices": [
        "By spy satellites detecting Soviet nuclear tests",
        "By using telescopes to observe them",
        "By analyzing data from space probes"
      ],
      "answer": "By spy satellites detecting Soviet nuclear tests",
      "explanation": "During the Cold War, spy satellites designed to detect Soviet nuclear tests in space accidentally discovered gamma ray bursts coming from space, leading to their initial detection."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the source of long gamma ray bursts (GRBs)?",
      "choices": [
        "Supernova explosions",
        "Collision of neutron stars",
        "Solar flares"
      ],
      "answer": "Supernova explosions",
      "explanation": "Long gamma ray bursts are thought to be produced by supernova explosions when the core of a massive star collapses to form a black hole."
    },
    {
      "question": "How wide could a gamma ray burst (GRB) be if it originated from a few thousand light years away?",
      "choices": [
        "10 light years",
        "50 light years",
        "100 light years"
      ],
      "answer": "100 light years",
      "explanation": "If a GRB originated from a few thousand light years away, it could be as wide as a hundred light years by the time it reaches us, potentially causing catastrophic effects on Earth."

    {
      "question": "What has been suggested as a possible cause of the Ordovician extinction 450 million years ago?",
      "choices": [
        "Supernova explosion",
        "Gamma ray burst",
        "Solar flare"
      ],
      "answer": "Gamma ray burst",
      "explanation": "A gamma ray burst has been suggested as one possible cause of the Ordovician extinction that occurred 450 million years ago, leading to the eradication of a significant portion of marine species."
