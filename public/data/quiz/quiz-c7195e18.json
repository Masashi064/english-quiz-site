  "introduction": "How will the Universe die? \n\nEverybody dies. The universe too? Well, probably. What are the current",

    {
      "question": "What is the reason behind the accelerating expansion of the universe?",
      "choices": [
        "dark energy",
        "gravity",
        "atoms"
      ],
      "answer": "dark energy",
      "explanation": "Dark energy is the mysterious force believed to be causing the acceleration of the universe's expansion."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the scenario where the expansion of the universe accelerates to a point where space expands so fast that gravity can't compensate anymore?",
      "choices": [
        "Big Rip",
        "Heat death",
        "Big Crunch"
      ],
      "answer": "Big Rip",
      "explanation": "In the Big Rip scenario, space expands so rapidly that even gravity is unable to hold structures like galaxies together, eventually leading to everything dissolving."
    },
    {
      "question": "In the Heat Death scenario, what happens to matter over an incredibly long but finite period?",
      "choices": [
        "converted into radiation",
        "converted into dark energy",
        "converted into stars"
      ],
      "answer": "converted into radiation",
      "explanation": "In Heat Death, matter stays intact but over time gets converted into radiation as the universe expands indefinitely."
    },
    {
      "question": "What theory suggests that the universe might go through an infinite cycle of expansion and contraction?",
      "choices": [
        "Big Bounce",
        "Big Freeze",
        "Big Crunch"
      ],
      "answer": "Big Bounce",
      "explanation": "The Big Bounce theory proposes that the universe has undergone multiple cycles of expansion and contraction, offering a more optimistic view of the universe's fate."

      "question": "What is the most likely scenario for the ultimate fate of the universe according to the video?",
      "choices": [
        "Heat death",
        "Big Crunch",
        "Big Bounce"
      ],
      "answer": "Heat death",
      "explanation": "At the moment, the most probable scenario for the end of the universe is Heat Death where all activity ceases, and the universe remains in a state of maximum entropy."
